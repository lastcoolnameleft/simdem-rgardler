# Test that remote scripts work OK

This file is intended to test that executing a script that is remote
from the client machine works. That is when the path to scripts is an
`http` address.

# Environment setup

The local environment should be set up.

```
echo $TEST
```
Results:

```
A local hello from the current working directory (where the simdem command was executed)
```
